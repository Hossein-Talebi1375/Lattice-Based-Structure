# Central Hole Structure Simulation

Simulate the dynamic behavior of a structure with a central hole using springs and nodes, visualized with matplotlib.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the simulation of a structural system with a central hole using a spring-node model. The simulation captures the dynamic interaction of springs, nodes, and the impact of a central hole on the structural integrity.

## Features

- **Dynamic Simulation**: The code dynamically simulates the behavior of the structure over a specified number of steps.
- **Visualization**: Utilizes matplotlib to visualize the nodes, springs, and the progression of the simulation.
- **Central Hole Representation**: Introduces a central hole with zero spring constant, showcasing its influence on the overall system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/central-hole-simulation.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   python central_hole_simulation.py
   ```

## Configuration

- `NUM_NODES_X` and `NUM_NODES_Y`: Adjust the number of nodes in the X and Y directions.
- `SPRING_CONSTANT`: Set the spring constant for regular springs.
- `DISPLACEMENT_RATE`: Define the constant rate of displacement for the top row nodes.
- `CRITICAL_STRETCH`: Set the critical stretch threshold for springs to break.
- `DAMPING_COEFFICIENT`: Define the damping coefficient for regular springs.

## Customization

Feel free to experiment with different parameters, initial conditions, or structural configurations by modifying the code.
